### A Brief Professional History
**Machine Learning Engineer/Applied Mathematician**
_Focusing on designing models from principled mathematical foundations and taking them to production_

Veteran of the game industry. 
I worked on the development and operation of several live MMO and social games 
wearing both machine learning and software/creative production hats 
(they go hand in hand in games).

I run an individual consultancy called Hashsignals. I help companies understand their 
problem spaces via statistical techniques such as longitudinal analyses 
and help them put appropriate machine learning methods into place 
in compute clouds or on the edge that become core to their products.

I also have a good understanding of cloud architecture & mobile front ends.

Key industry verticals have included Paas/Saas companies and creative 
industries such as the game industry.
