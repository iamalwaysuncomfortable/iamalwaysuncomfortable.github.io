## Michael Turner

_Senior Software Engineer Specializing in Cryptographic Systems and Machine Learning_

Ethically I strive to work towards products that protect people's privacy and help society be more evenly distributed. As a veteran of the game industry, I have seen how data usage within the last decade has not respected people's right to privacy and been applied to create digital addictions. This paradigm need not exist, products can be of great utility without compromising privacy or exploiting end users

I am focused on integrating concepts from cryptography and modeling mathematics that acheive products are both "smart" and private
