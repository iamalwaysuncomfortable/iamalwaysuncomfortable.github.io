### A Brief Professional History
Data scientist with serious chops in full stack development.

9 year veteran of the game industry. While there,
I focused in building back ends and analytics suites for 
massive online and social games wearing both data scientist and production hats. 

In 2014 I launched a consultancy called Hashsignals that uses modern statistical and machine learning 
methods to help companies understand and engage their clients. 
Our key industry verticals have included Paas/Saas companies and creative 
industries such as the game industry. We often partner with very close 
associates to build out full stack software solutions.
