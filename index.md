## Michael Turner

_Senior Software Engineer Specializing in Cryptographic Systems and Machine Learning_

My ideological drive is working towards products and tools that protect people's privacy and help society be more evenly distributed. In that vein I put a lot of mental energy into thinking about what combination of existing technologies and invention can be used to build open systems that are accessible for people to use and operate.

## Things I'm Good At
